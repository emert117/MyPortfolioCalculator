# My Portfolio Calculator


I spent most of my time to check the correctness of the calculation.
Release notes:
- Added parallelism

Notes:
- be careful about Big O Notation
- when you calculate a portfolio note it. You can use it to compare results to test your code after code changes.
- I will add extra unit tests
- User input checking and file data checking can be added 
- Batch processing at the and of the week,day, hour, on bank holidays, on weekends can be done
- If storing of totals in database are not preferred, maybe we can cache them and invalidate when a buy/sell occurs
